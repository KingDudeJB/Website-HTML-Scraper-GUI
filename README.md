# Website-HTML-Scraper-GUI
This is a personal programming project, its not a big project... It is designed to analyse a website, gather the HTML source code from the (Inspect) section of a site and display it in the form of a GUI. 'small heads up, most sites do not allow the scan to work due to security'.
